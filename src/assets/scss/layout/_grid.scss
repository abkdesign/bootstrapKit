/*
The Mixins
There are a number of mixins available for constructing a grid. They include:

@include make-row;
Creates a row just like adding a class of .row would.
@include make-*-column(*);
Creates a column just like adding a class of .col-xs-12 would. Breakpoints come first and are xs, sm, md and lg followed by the number of columns.
@include make-*-column-offset(*);
Move a column to the right useing offset. Increases the left margin of a column by * columns.
@include make-*-column-push(*);
Change the order of a column by pushing it.
@include make-*-column-pull(*);
Change the order of a column by pulling it.
*/
// Creates a wrapper for a series of columns
@include make-row();

// Make the element grid-ready (applying everything but the width)
@include make-col-ready();
@include make-col($size, $columns: $grid-columns);

// Get fancy by offsetting, or changing the sort order
@include make-col-offset($size, $columns: $grid-columns);

.example-container {
  width: 800px;
  @include make-container();
}

.example-row {
  @include make-row();
}

.example-content-main {
  @include make-col-ready();

  @include media-breakpoint-up(sm) {
    @include make-col(6);

    @include make-col(8);
